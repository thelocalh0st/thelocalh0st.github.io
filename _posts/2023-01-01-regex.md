## Introduction

**Regular expressions**  (or Regex) are patterns of text that you define to search documents and match exactly what you’re looking for.

----------

## Charsets

A charset is defined by enclosing in  `[`  square brackets  `]`  the character(s), or range of characters that we want to match. Then, it finds  **every occurrence**  of the pattern we have defined in the file/text we are searching.

To  **exclude**  certain characters from a charset, we use the  `^`  hat symbol. For example  `[^k]ing`  will match  `ring`,  `sing`,  `$ing`, but not  `king`.

If we want to exclude charsets, not just single characters, we can do it just like this :  `[^a-c]at`  will match  `fat`  and  `hat`, but not  `bat`  or  `cat`.

**Match all of the following characters: c, o, g**

> `[cog]`

**Match all of the following words: cat, fat, hat**

> `[cfh]at`

**Match all of the following words: Cat, cat, Hat, hat**

> `[cChH]at`

**Match all of the following filenames: File1, File2, file3, file4, file5, File7, file9**

> `[fF]ile[1-9]`

**Match all of the filenames of question 4, except “File7”**

> `[fF]ile[^7]`

----------

## Wildcards and optional characters

The wildcard that is used to match any single character (except the line break) is the  `.`  dot. That means that  `a.c`  will match  `aac`,  `abc`,  `a0c`,  `a!c`, and so on.

Also, we can set a character as optional in our pattern using the  `?`  question mark. That means that  `abc?`  will match  `ab`  and  `abc`, since the  `c`  is optional.

If we want to search for  `.`  a literal dot, we have to  **escape it**  with a  `\`  reverse slash. That means that  `a.c`  will match  `a.c`, but also  `abc`,  `a@c`, and so on. But  `a\.c`  will match  **just**  `a.c`.

**Match all of the following words: Cat, fat, hat, rat**

> `.at`

**Match all of the following words: Cat, cats**

> `[cC]ats?`

**Match the following domain name: cat.xyz**

> `cat\.xyz`

**Match all of the following domain names: cat.xyz, cats.xyz, hats.xyz**

> `[ch]ats?\.xyz`

**Match every 4-letter string that doesn’t end in any letter from n to z**

> `...[^n-z]`

**Match bat, bats, hat, hats, but not rat or rats**

> `[^r]ats?`

----------

## Metacharacters and repetitions

There are easier ways to match bigger charsets. For example,  `\d`  is used to match any  **single**  digit. Here’s a reference:  
`\d`  matches a digit, like  `9`  
`\D`  matches a non-digit, like  `A`  or  `@`  
`\w`  matches an alphanumeric character, like  `a`  or  `3`  
`\W`  matches a non-alphanumeric character, like  `!`  or  `#`  
`\s`  matches a whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and line breaks)  
`\S`  matches everything else (alphanumeric characters and symbols)

Underscores  `_`  are included in the  `\w`  metacharacter and not in  `\W`. That means that  `\w`  will match every single character in  `test_file`.

Often we want a pattern that matches many characters of a single type in a row, and we can do that with repetitions. For example,  `{2}`  is used to match the preceding character (or metacharacter, or charset) two times in a row. That means that  `z{2}`  will match exactly  `zz`.

Here’s a reference for each repetition along with how many times it matches the preceding pattern:

`{12}`  -  **exactly 12**  times.  
`{1,5}`  -  **1 to 5**  times.  
`{2,}`  -  **2 or more**  times.  
`*`  -  **0 or more**  times.  
`+`  -  **1 or more**  times.

**Match the following word: catssss**

> `cats{4}`

**Match all of the following words (use the * sign): Cat, cats, catsss**

> `[cC]ats*`

**Match all of the following sentences (use the + sign): regex go br, regex go brrrrrr**

> `regex go br+`

**Match all of the following filenames: ab0001, bb0000, abc1000, cba0110, c0000 (don’t use a metacharacter)**

> `[abc]{1,3}[01]{4}`

**Match all of the following filenames: File01, File2, file12, File20, File99**

> `[fF]ile\d{1,2}`

**Match all of the following folder names: kali tools, kali tools**

> `kali\s+tools`

**Match all of the following filenames: notes~, stuff@, gtfob#, lmaoo!**

> `\w{5}\W`

**Match the string in quotes (use the * sign and the \s, \S metacharacters): “2f0h@f0j0%! a)K!F49h!FFOK”**

> `\S*\s*\S*`

**Match every 9-character string (with letters, numbers, and symbols) that doesn’t end in a “!” sign**

> `\S{8}[^!]`

**Match all of these filenames (use the + symbol): .bash_rc, .unnecessarily_long_filename, and note1**

> `\.?\w+`

----------

## Starts with/ ends with, groups, and either/ or

Sometimes it’s very useful to specify that we want to search by a certain pattern  **in the beginning or the end of a line**. We do that with these characters:  
`^`  - starts with  
`$`  - ends with

So for example, if we want to search for a line that  **starts with**  `abc`, we can use  `^abc`.  
If you want to search for a line that  **ends with**  `xyz`, you can use  `xyz$`.

Note that the  `^`  hat symbol is used to exclude a charset when enclosed in  `[`square brackets`]`, but when it is not, it is used to specify the beginning of a word.

We can also define groups by enclosing a pattern in  `(`parentheses`)`. We will use it to define an  **either/ or**  pattern, and also to repeat patterns. To say “or” in Regex, we use the  `|`  pipe.

For an “either/or” pattern example, the pattern  `during the (day|night)`  will match both of these sentences:  `during the day`  and  `during the night`.

**Match every string that starts with “Password:” followed by any 10 characters excluding “0”**

> `^Password:[^0]{10}`

**Match “username: " in the beginning of a line (note the space!)**

> `^username:\s`

**Match every line that doesn’t start with a digit (use a metacharacter)**

> `^\d`

**Match this string at the end of a line: EOF$**

> `EOF\$$`

**Match all of the following sentences:**

-   I use nano
    
-   I use vim
    
    > `I use (nano|vim)`
    

**Match all lines that start with $, followed by any single digit, followed by $, followed by one or more non-whitespace characters**

> `\$\d\$\S+`

**Match every possible IPv4 IP address (use metacharacters and groups)**

> `(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}`

**Match all of these emails while also adding the username and the domain name (not the TLD) in separate groups (use \w):  [hello@tryhackme.com](mailto:hello@tryhackme.com),  [username@domain.com](mailto:username@domain.com),  [dummy_email@xyz.com](mailto:dummy_email@xyz.com)**

> `(\w+)@(\w+)\.com`
